# Streamlining ML Pipelines for Clinical Workflow in Risk Factor Analysis for Cardiovascular Disease

### Overview:

This project aims to analyze cardiovascular datasets using machine learning (ML) pipelines to identify the key social and biological risk factors contributing to heart disease. By streamlining clinical workflows, we aim to develop a predictive model with a high accuracy rate while visualizing the data to improve awareness and understanding of the risk factors involved.

### Methodology:

Data Collection: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, containing relevant features that contribute to heart disease risk.

Preprocessing: Preprocessing included cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, normalizing features, and preparing it for machine learning tasks.

Machine Learning Model Development: Multiple machine learning models were applied and compared, including: KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest

Data Visualization: The results were visualized using Tableau to create interactive dashboards and storyboards for easy understanding and interpretation.

Model Evaluation: Comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms and deep learning methods was performed, resulting in a 20% improvement in prediction efficiency.

### Results:

Predictive Accuracy: The developed machine learning models achieved over 90% accuracy in predicting the likelihood of heart disease.

Identified Risk Factors: Major risk factors identified include blood pressure, glucose levels, work type, and smoking status.

Interactive Dashboards: More than 5 interactive dashboards and storyboards were created in Tableau, offering a detailed breakdown of the insights.
